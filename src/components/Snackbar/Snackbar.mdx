The Snackbar component is a short, temporary notification that appears at the bottom of the screen. It is typically used to provide feedback to the user after an action has been performed, such as a successful submission of a form or completion of a task

It is important to use the Snackbar component sparingly, as it can be disruptive if used excessively. It is generally recommended to use it only for important or time-sensitive notifications.

ðŸ’¡ The Snackbar is a brief, temporary notification that should not be used excessively. Overusing the Snackbar can be disruptive and may cause users to ignore it.

ðŸ’¡ The Snackbar is best used for notifications that are important or time-sensitive. For example, if a form submission is successful or a task has been completed, the Snackbar can be used to provide feedback to the user.

ðŸ’¡ The Snackbar component has several props that can be used to customize its appearance and behavior. For example, you can use the left prop to align the Snackbar to the left or right side of the screen, and the timeout prop to control the amount of time it is displayed.

ðŸ’¡ The Snackbar should be tested on different screen sizes to ensure that it is displayed correctly and does not overlap with other content.

ðŸ’¡ The Snackbar is not the best choice for displaying critical errors or warnings. For these types of notifications, it is generally better to use a modal or an alert.
