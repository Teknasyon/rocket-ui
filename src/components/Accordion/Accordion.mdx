# Accordion

The Accordion component is a UI element that allows the user to show and hide content within an expandable and collapsible section. It consists of a container that holds multiple panels, where each panel has a header and a body. When a panel's header is clicked, the corresponding body is shown or hidden.

## Overview <a id="overview" />

The Accordion component provides a compact way of displaying large amounts of information in a small space. It is particularly useful for displaying hierarchical data, where each panel represents a different level of information. The Accordion component is also a good way to present frequently asked questions (FAQs) as it makes it easy for users to find the information they are looking for.

ðŸ’¡ Use clear and concise headings for each panel's header to help users quickly understand the content within each panel.

ðŸ’¡ Consider using icons or graphics within the header to make the accordion more visually appealing.

ðŸ’¡ Make sure that the accordion is accessible to users who may be using assistive technologies, such as screen readers.

ðŸ’¡ Use the modelValue prop wisely to control the default state of the accordion. For example, you might want to set the modelValue prop to true for the panel that contains the most important information.

ðŸ’¡ Try to limit the amount of content within each panel to ensure that the accordion remains compact and easy to use.
