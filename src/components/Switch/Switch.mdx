### Overview <a id="overview" />

The Switch component is a simple toggle that allows the user to switch between two states: on and off. It is designed to be used as a controlled component, meaning that the value prop must be provided and will determine the current state of the switch.

## Usage with props <a id="usage" />

### modelValue (required)

The **modelValue** prop determines the current state of the switch. When the modelValue prop is true, the switch will be in the "on" state, and when it is false, the switch will be in the "off" state.

### size (optional)

The **size** prop setermines the size of the switch. Accepts the values small, medium (default), and large.

### id (optional)

The **id** prop sets the HTML id attribute on the switch element. This can be useful for connecting the switch to a label element using the for attribute.

### disabled (optional)

If the **disabled** prop is true, the switch will be disabled and the user will not be able to toggle it.

### label (optional)

The **label** prop sets the label text for the switch. This can be used to provide additional context or instructions for the switch.

### hint (optional)

The **hint** prop sets a hint text for the switch. This can be used to provide additional information about the switch, such as its purpose or how it is used.

### errorMsg (optional)

The **errorMsg** prop sets an error message for the switch. This can be used to display an error message when the switch is in an invalid state or when it has been used in an incorrect way.

### reverse (optional)

If the **reverse** prop is true, the switch will be reversed, meaning that the "on" state will be on the left and the "off" state will be on the right.
