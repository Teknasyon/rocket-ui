## Usage with props <a id="usage" />

## placement (optional) and text (optional)

It supports various **placement** options such as top, right, bottom, and left, as well as more specific placements like top-start, top-end, right-start, right-end, bottom-start, bottom-end, left-start, and left-end. The **text** prop allows developers to specify the text that will be displayed in the tooltip.

## light (optional) and dark (optional)

The **light** and **dark** props can be used to change the color scheme of the tooltip.

## autoHide (optional) and hideDelay (optional)

The **autoHide** prop allows the tooltip to automatically hide after a specified delay, while the **hideDelay** and showDelay props can be used to control the delay before the tooltip is hidden or shown.

## shown (optional) and disabled (optional)

The **shown** prop can be used to manually control the visibility of the tooltip, while the **disabled** prop can be used to disable the tooltip entirely.

## offset (optional), padding (optional) and outsideClick (optional)

The **offset** and **padding** props can be used to adjust the position of the tooltip, and the **outsideClick** prop allows developers to specify whether the tooltip should be hidden when the user clicks outside of it.

## persistent (optional)

The **persistent** prop allows you to create tooltips that remain open even when other tooltips are opened. This is useful for tooltips that contain important information that should stay visible while the user interacts with other parts of the interface.

## resizable (optional)

The **resizable** prop can be used to specify whether the tooltip should be resizable.

## Tips <a id="tips" />

ðŸ’¡ Tooltips are meant to provide additional information or context, so it's important to keep the text short and to the point. Avoid using long sentences or paragraphs of text, as it can make the tooltip difficult to read and may cause the user to lose interest.

ðŸ’¡ The placement of the tooltip can greatly affect its effectiveness. Use clear and consistent placement across your application to make it easy for the user to understand where the tooltip will appear.

ðŸ’¡ The delay before the tooltip appears and disappears can greatly affect the user's experience. Experiment with different values for the showDelay and hideDelay props to find the right balance between making the tooltip appear quickly enough to be useful but not so quickly that it becomes distracting.

ðŸ’¡ Use the light and dark props to match the tooltip color scheme with the overall theme of your application. This will make the tooltip feel like a natural part of the interface.

ðŸ’¡ The offset prop allows you to adjust the position of the tooltip relative to the trigger element. Use it to fine-tune the placement of the tooltip and make it feel more natural.

ðŸ’¡ The padding prop can be used to add space around the tooltip text, which can make it easier to read.

ðŸ’¡ This can improve the user experience by preventing the tooltip from staying visible when the user is no longer interacting with the trigger element.

ðŸ’¡ Use the **outsideClick** prop when you want tooltips to close when users click elsewhere. This is particularly useful for click-triggered tooltips that contain interactive content.

ðŸ’¡ Use the **persistent** prop for important tooltips that should remain visible while users interact with other parts of the interface. However, use this sparingly as too many persistent tooltips can clutter the interface.

ðŸ’¡ When using multiple tooltips, consider the interaction between **persistent** and non-persistent tooltips. Non-persistent tooltips will close each other, but persistent tooltips will remain open.

ðŸ’¡ Always test the tooltip with real users to see how it works in practice and to gather feedback on how it can be improved.
