## Tips <a id="tips" />

ðŸ’¡ Tooltips are meant to provide additional information or context, so it's important to keep the text short and to the point. Avoid using long sentences or paragraphs of text, as it can make the tooltip difficult to read and may cause the user to lose interest.

ðŸ’¡ The placement of the tooltip can greatly affect its effectiveness. Use clear and consistent placement across your application to make it easy for the user to understand where the tooltip will appear.

ðŸ’¡ The delay before the tooltip appears and disappears can greatly affect the user's experience. Experiment with different values for the showDelay and hideDelay props to find the right balance between making the tooltip appear quickly enough to be useful but not so quickly that it becomes distracting.

ðŸ’¡ Use the light and dark props to match the tooltip color scheme with the overall theme of your application. This will make the tooltip feel like a natural part of the interface.

ðŸ’¡ The offset prop allows you to adjust the position of the tooltip relative to the trigger element. Use it to fine-tune the placement of the tooltip and make it feel more natural.

ðŸ’¡ The padding prop can be used to add space around the tooltip text, which can make it easier to read.

ðŸ’¡ This can improve the user experience by preventing the tooltip from staying visible when the user is no longer interacting with the trigger element.

ðŸ’¡ Always test the tooltip with real users to see how it works in practice and to gather feedback on how it can be improved.
