 * The Icon component is a graphical element that is used to visually represent an idea, concept, or action. It is typically used in conjunction with text or other graphical elements to provide a clear and concise way of conveying information to the user. It is highly customizable, allowing the developer to control the size, color, and style of the icon to match the design of the application.
 * <br><br>The Icon component is a versatile and useful tool for adding visual emphasis and clarity to an application's user interface. It is important to use icons consistently and thoughtfully in order to create a cohesive and intuitive user experience.
 * <br><br>To access a comprehensive list of icons available in our design system, please refer to the icon list page by clicking [the following link](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Icons\&icon.style=Rounded).

ðŸ’¡ Choose a set of icons that are visually consistent and easy to understand. This will help create a cohesive look and feel for your application.

ðŸ’¡ Icons should be used to supplement text, not replace it. Text is still the most effective way to convey information, so make sure to use icons in conjunction with clear, concise text labels.

ðŸ’¡ Make sure to choose an icon that accurately represents the action or concept it is being used to represent. Using the wrong icon can lead to confusion for the user.

ðŸ’¡ Choose colors and sizes for your icons that are consistent with the overall design of your application. Large, bright icons may be attention-grabbing, but they can also be overwhelming if used too frequently.

ðŸ’¡ Make sure to consider accessibility when using icons. Use appropriate alt text for your icons, and consider providing additional information for users who may be unable to see the icons.
